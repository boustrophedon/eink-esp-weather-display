This is the rendering code for https://harrystern.net/halldisplay.html

This directory contains code that gathers weather and todo data from standard HTTP REST APIs, draws graphs and text displaying that data into an image buffer, and then formats the image data so that it can be directly displayed on a waveshare e-ink display. The data is saved to a file which can be served from a normal webserver like nginx.
